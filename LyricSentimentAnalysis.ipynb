im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil its me my honestys brutal but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak a revolver and a  see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im morphin into an immortal comin through the portal youre stuck in a time warp from  though and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for youre pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the

get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh hes too mainstream well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it its not hiphop its popcause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i dont know how to make songs like that i dont know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while im rippin any one of these s that versus you its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you how many s i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school

speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you im drunk so satan take the fucking wheel ima sleep in the front seat bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then but if i cant batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake em a cake then dont mistake him for satan its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be oas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face

the worry but allinall my productivity had stayed urgent face your fears always knew that i would make it here where the energy is magnified and persevered consciousness is synchronized and crystalclear euphoria is glorified and made his reflectin on my life and what i done paid dues made rules change outta love them same views made schools change curriculums but didnt change me starin down the barrel of the gun should i feel resentful i didnt see my full potential should i feel regret about the good that i was into everything is everything this aint coincidental i woke up that

over you make sure my kids watch all my interviews make sure you live out our dreams we produced keep that genius in your brain on the move and to my neighborhood let the good prevail make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail look for salvation when troubles get real cause you cant help the world until you help yourself and i cant blame the hood the day that i was killed yall had to see it
