And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  [Chorus] And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I can find a way, find a way  [Verse 2] While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true  [Chorus] And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I can find a way, while she waits while she waits for meYou might also likeEmbed\"},\n",

Did you turn off that violent old movie you\\'re watching And turn on \"I Love Lucy\" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood?

With your quiet voice and impeccable style Don't ever let them steal your joy And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild They can kick dirt in your face Dress you down, and tell you that your place Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine I see you tugging on your shirt Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts  [Chorus] Let 'em laugh while they can Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends And the joke's on them  [Verse 2] You get discouraged, don't you, girl? It's your brother's world for a while longer You gotta dance with the devil on a river To beat the stream Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder They come to kick dirt in your face To call you weak and then displace you After carrying your baby on your back across the desert I saw your eyes behind your hair And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared See Brandi Carlile LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like[Chorus] Let 'em laugh while they can Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends And the joke's on them  [Chorus] Let 'em laugh while they can Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends And the joke's on them10Embed\"},\n",

Can you hear us now?  [Verse 1: Alicia Keys] I have a voice Started out a whisper, turned into a scream Made a beautiful noise Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze But when you band together, it's a choir Of thunder and rain Now we have a choice 'Cause I have a voice [Outro: Brandi Carlile] Now we have a choice 'Cause I have a voice  [Outro: Alicia Keys] Now we have a choice  [Outro: both] 'Cause I have a voiceEmbed\"},\n",

Where you at? What's on your mind? They say every life precious but nobody care about mine  [Pre-Chorus: Logic] I've been on the low, I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo) I've been on the low, I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine You might also like[Chorus: Logic] I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why [Verse 2: Alessia Cara] It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is I know that you'll thank God you did  [Verse 3: Logic] I know where you been, where you are, where you goin' I know you're the reason I believe in life What's the day without a little night? I'm just tryna shed a little light It can be hard It can be so hard But you gotta live right now You got everything to give right now  [Pre-Chorus: Logic] I've been on the low, I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate?
